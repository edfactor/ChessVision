# Data

The dataset was collected from a combination of photos of chessbooks taken from the local library together with photos of chessboards on computer screens, kindle screens, newspapers, etc. All the images are cropped to a square aspect ratio. The original raw dataset is not contained in this repository because it is too large.

The data used for training the models is now available on [quilt](https://quiltdata.com/)!

The two datasets can be found at 
 + [chesspieces](https://quiltdata.com/package/gudbrandtandberg/chesspieces)
 + [chessboards](https://quiltdata.com/package/gudbrandtandberg/chessboard_segmentation)

The masks for chessboard segmentation are acquired manually using [dataturks](https://dataturks.com).
